# superAnthony3

I am trying to draw a 3D robot so called Super Anthony animated via webGL programming in js.

## show the robot on web html page, in superAnthony3.html

## use a 3D cube as the basic object, in cube.js

## animate 3D objects via webGL GPU shader programs, in index.js

## rotate angles of 16 motors to move the robot and the scene in superAnthony.js 

## handle UI controls via event handlers, in eventHandlers.js

## calculate 3D motion via matrix operation, in glMatrix-0.9.5.js

## repeat animation frames via the function called in webgl-utils.js

## provide a convenient forth script via oneWordVM, in oneWordVM.js
